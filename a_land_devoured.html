    <p> Ye renegades–<br /><br />
    
    With all due respect, you are as the title suggests <i>classless</i>.<br /><br />
    
    All of you have played D&D before, and so may have certain expectations about rules
    and stats and how this is going to fit into how we or others have played before.<br /><br />
    
    It has been deliberate, not ascribing you 'fighter' or 'cleric' or 'mage'. Not that I don't
    think these serve as excellent figureheads or more simply 'heads' of classes, I simply want
    you to flesh out an entirely unique character. <br /><br />
    
    All of you are developing particularities, and I would see those develop. As you approach the 
    coming challenges, be daring in your decisions. Try me on what you think you can do. <br /><br />
    
    This is your story. Your Legend. I am simply the setting and the judge.  <br /><br />

        Good Early Afternoon, ye dangerous ones.<br /><br />
        
        The sun of Denver barely creeps into my basement, now. I've made do with a few overhead lights and a
        plethora of lamps. That and the glare of computer screen.<br /><br />
        
        Each of you will notice the click of doors shut, how perhaps the questions you've asked do not reach
        the ears of those you'd hoped. <br /><br />
        
        Perhaps the mist of this world hang lower today, obscuring what 
        you know; perhaps finding yourself somewhere in here is the best you can hope for, at least for now.<br /><br />
        
        Hope too that the shapes that thrive in the shadows are those of your friends.<br /><br />
        
        Know too that from six you are five, and so the dangers of the mist & the dark appear 
        that much longer in the tooth.<br /><br />
        
        Weigh anchor, children, <span class="char_solo" onClick="character_solo()">the sun alights</span>. <br /><br />
        
        Please have your responses in by next weekend. You've all been doing a wonderful job. Vast your explorations be.<br /><br />

        Heroes, bonjour.
        <br /><br />
        I've returned from Canadian boundaries. Twas fun, but I missed you. 
        <br /><br />I've done further exploring and
        much of the AD&D reference guides (beyond the Players Handbook) are online now, for free. They lack their
        original wonderful imagery but they'll serve as quality guides for further development of your characters.
        <bR /><br />
        Your response times were quick, so I'm going
        to try to shorten my deadlines slightly to see if we can bring in the slack a bit, whip up a frenzy of adventure.
        <br /><br />           Shall we continue with this? <br /><br />
        Please respond to the new post by September 7th. Thanks.

        <br /><br /> The death-cry of a pig, similar to the cry of an infant comes through the small window. A bluster

    <h1>A Swirl of Memory</h1>
    	<p>
        In hand, I've a sheaf of papers. Your memories, tiny scraps of that which you can recollect.<br /><br />
        Hold onto them. The world around you is very different now. <br /><br /><br /><br />
        Each of you is alone in a small primitive hut, dried bamboo rods running circular about you. The floor is the
         wide length of a giant tree-limb. <br /><br />
        Light pours into the small hut in an auburn mist; outside, the squack of bird, the buzz of insect.<br /><br />
        The humidity brings your hands to your face, the sweat almost a dew on your forehead, your neck and back. <br /><br />
        You are not dressed as you were before, but in small clothes of a white soft cloth.<br /><br />

    	<p>It seems the storm has gathered appropriately outside.<br /><br />
        
        Thank you to each of you for sending me your character basics. The team assembleth and
        my does it look so good.<br /><br />
        
        One hero fell to the side of the road, but one has joined (coincidence? or does six seem so right!):<br /><br />
         <span class="black">Kelsey </span>by  player name. Kelsey will embody the 
         steady-willed <span class="kelaric">Kellaric Starbyrn</span>, a half-elf. Kelsey is friend to:<br /><br />
        
        <span class="black">Brian</span>, cousin-grown-to-man, has shifted into the light footfalls of <span class="vidius">
        Vidius Aindur</span>, an elf. And, brethren be:<br /><br />
        
        <span class="black">Mark</span>, blowing dust from an old character sheet made new, will walk with <span class="morham">Morham</span>, 
        also half-elven. But at his side:<br /><br />
        
        Friend and longtime neighbor– <span class="black">Katie K</span>, will weave as<span class="june"> June</span> the 
        nimble hand and persistent curiousity of a halfling.<br /><br />
       
       	And cousin strung from the far side of this continent: <span class="black">Ben</span> who marshalls <span class="leon">Leon Thistelbottom</span>
        from his home, the third of the half-elven variety. <br /><br />
        
        Last, <span class="black">Katie B</span>, cousin minen, who rides with red-haired <span class="dalziel">Dalziel</span>, a blend of
        human and halfling.<br /><br />
        
        So you see your troop assembled. <br /><br />
        
        Please send me the last memory your character remembers by 5 post-meridiem on Monday, August 12th.<br /><br />

    <h1>A Land Devoured</h1>
        <p>Welcome, yes?<br /><br />
        
        An appropriate start. <br /><br />
        
        It is 3:23 on a Thursday. I’m nearly through my second beer. My elbow is skinned enough 
        that the blood is fresh and unfortunately not drying quickly. It was a bike-ride.<br /><br />
        
        I’m through trying to scribe translations of poets who are living in a world above mine. 
        I’m ready to tell you about my world and as importantly, ready to invite you there.<br /><br />
        
        Welcome to <em>A Land Devoured</em>. Here there is story, waiting for you. Waiting for you to be 
        part of the story, most accurately.<br /><br />
        
        <em>A Land Devoured</em> is an interactive adventure-tale, an online interpretation of AD&D 2nd 
        Edition rules, narrated by me, played by you six (or perhaps others, if the adventure groweth).<br /><br />
        
        For now, suffice it to say that you’ve been invited to take part in something I and you
         have not done in this way before. Each of you has received an email and been directed here.<br /><br />
        
        I will begin narrating this adventure on September 5th. That is a Thursday. That is 
        when your characters will meet one another; or, be in the same room – I leave you to do your own ‘introductions’<br /><br />
        
        In the email I’ve sent you is a PDF copy of the Players Handbook using the rules I would 
        like to muster for this. You do not need to be completely familiar with it in entirety, 
        but you do need to make a character and send me the basics.<br /><br />
        
        <em>But what are the basics, teach</em>? You may remember, but here is a reminder:<br /><br />
        
        A name.<br /><br />
        
        Six Basic Stats – STRength, DEXterity, CONstitution, INTelligence, WISdom, and 
        CHArisma – please find a die (a six-sided one) and roll it six times. Write those numbers down.<br /><br />
        
        Now do it again.<br /><br />
        
        Pick one of those sets of six, and assign each number to a Basic Stat. <br /><br />
        
        Don’t cheat. If you feel like both options you had were terrible, see me. <br /><br />
        
        A race – unless you’ve made special request by me, those are: Human, Half-Elf, Elf, 
        Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling or some combination therewithin.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        
        
        
        That’s really all I want. The rest will be part of the process of discovery. 
        Think of yourself as a little naked baby who is older than a baby. <br /><br /><br /><br />
        
        
        
        So a little naked adult.<br /><br /><br /><br />
        
        
        You’ll hear from me when I’ve heard from you. Please respond to the email with 
        your Character’s basics by Wednesday (July 31st) of next week to be included.<br /><br />
        
        Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />
