    	<h1>Chust Enough</h1>
        <p>You pick up the net and hold it in both hands. A dizzying crack and the door splits open.<br /><br /> 
        
        As if it'd just pushed the door open, a behemoth chust bug turns and lumbers step-by-step into
        a lit cave of foliage and fauna, triangular head awobble. 
        </p>

    <div class="post" id="the_collector">
    	<h1>The Collector</h1>
        <p>
        <span class="june">How did you get that? </span><br /><br />
        
       Your attempt to quell your irritation but realize the situation is somewhat out of your hands. <br /><br />
        
      You sigh. <span class="june">Each of these is a subspecies of Lycaena: <i>boldernarum, feredayi, rauparaha</i>, and <i>salustius</i>. Together they represent the entire species. It was my first complete collection.</span><br /><br />
        
            You pause, looking closer at the relic.<br /><br />
        
         <span class="june">That's why some of the thoraces are sort of flattened out or smushed actually. I was a little girl and my chubby thumbs were too eager to stuff in the pins.</span><br /><br />
        
         The woman's eyes close slowly, and when she opens them, they glisten. She looks back at the bearded man and stands, exiting the room with your collection. He closes the door silently behind her, mutters a few unhearable words, and rubs at his wrist. <br /><br />
        
        A stool disassembled levitates in through the window and reassembles itself before him. He sits and glides towards you.<br /><br />
        
        <span class="black">Collector</span>, he says flatly, looking at you and then past you at nothing –he seems somehow tired, but then snaps up sharply– <span class="black">it appears time for a test</span>.<br /><br />
        
        His eyes burn down into yours, a darkness spreading from the pupils outward across the white and with a slight chant, he tosses a small powder across your face. The world blackens, flashes, and you are alone in the room. <br /><br />
        
        A silver-mesh butterfly net is at your knees, white-handled.<br /><br />
        
        
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="soundless">
        <h1>Soundless</h1>
        <p><span class="black">I understand</span>, says the woman. <span class="black">One does not always wish to speak.</span><br /><br />
        
        She looks to the man, who knocks on the door three times.<br /><br />
        
        The door opens and the man receives a plate of pig, wild-rice, and beans from someone outside. He hands it to the woman and
        she walks it over to you, wings in flux, and places the food and a canteen of water at your feet.<br /><br />
        
       	Then she holds out what she'd clutched to her chest. 
        
        <br /><br />You recognize it
        immediately as one of your smaller butterfly collections. Four of the creatures are pinned to a soft
        white cushion, framed and held behind glass. Tiny labels under each are in your handwriting– all four are samples from the
        Lycaena family.<br /><br />
       
        <span class="black">Tell me something about this</span>, she says, and there is a hint of menace in her voice. 
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="hello_june">
        <h1>Hello, June</h1>
        <p>A tremendous woman with folded wings steps through the door.<br /><br />
        She holds something to her chest, smiles at you, closes the door. <br /><br />
        <span class="black">You are feeling well, I hope?</span> she says, seeming sure of the answer. The wings flap open,
        iridescent blues, violets seeming to ripple across their surface.
        <br /><br />A young man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in the door and stands
        at its entrance. He holds a slim stick, is acknowledged by the woman.<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Would you care for something to eat?</span> she asks.</p>
