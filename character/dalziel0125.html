<div id="main_content">

	<div class="post" id="ooze">
    <h1>Oozing Forward</h1>
    <p>From beneath the door, a liquid, a slime of sorts, rolls across the floor.</p>
    </div>
	
    <div class="post" id="thief">
    	<h1>Thief</h1>
    	<p><span class="dalziel">I was stealing them from you when you walked in, Chalnar.</span><br /><br />

		You rub the old bruise on your face again. A tinge of pain runs from your cheek down the side of your neck. <br /><br />

		<span class="dalziel">I feel that you've already gotten in some payback and you've clearly got them back. 
        Why do you ask? And what do you mean that 'they' brought you here? Who ARE they? Why are WE here?</span><br /><br />

		<span class="black">My emeralds. Yes.</span> He seems almost to be convincing himself. He puts them back in the bag. 
        <span class="black">And you were stealing them from me.</span><br /><br />

		He seems doubtful as he looks back at the bearded man. The other waves him out and he turns, taking bag with him. <br /><br />

		On the door's close, the man rubs at his wrist and mutters a slight, unhearable series of words.<br /><br /> 

		A stool in pieces levitates in through the slats of the window and reassembles itself in front of the 
        man who sits on it, the feet inches from the ground.<br /><br />

		<span class="black">Thief</span>, he says, voice flat, <span class="black">it seems time for a test</span>.<br /><br />

		His eyes burn down into yours, a darkness spreading from the pupils outward across the white and with a slight chant, he tosses a small powder across your face. With an unexpected lurch, the world blackens, flashes, and you are alone in the room.<br /><br />

        One of the emeralds rocks back and forth, slower and slower to a stop, there at your knees.<br /><br /></p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="post" id="emeraldless">
    <h1>Emeraldless</h1>
    
    <p><span class="dalziel">Yes, I'll take some food. You wouldn't bring me all the way out here to poison me.</span>
    <br /><br />Chalnar nods, indicates to the young man who knocks on the door.<br /><br />
    <span class="dalziel">Where is here? What is going on, Chalnar?</span> You cough slightly into your hand.<br /><br />
    <span class="black">Here?</span> he repeats your question. <span class="black">I'd ask you the same question. They brought me 
    with you.</span> <br /><br />You're impressed he's not sweating.<br /><br /> 
    <span class="dalziel">I'm sorry about your wife but.. this seems a bit extreme.</span><br /><br /> 
    He nods again and looks back at the young man, then turns back to you. <br /><br />
    <span class="black">Let's not get too far into 'extreme', shall we, Dalziel? </span><br /><br />
    The young man receives a steaming plate of pig, wild-rice and beans from someone, hands it to Chalnar who walks it
    over to you, setting it at your feet. 
    <br /><br /><span class="black">I need you to explain these</span>, he says, and pulls the black bag from his pocket, soft black velvet.
    <br /><br />
    You recognize it immediately, and know too even as he's taking the pains to unroll it and spill them out in front of you, exactly
    what will be in the bag. <br /><br /><span class="black">Tell me about these.</span> He holds one of the emeralds up into the light.
    
    
    
    
    <div class="post" id="hello_dalziel">
    <h1>Hello, Dalziel</h1>
    
    <p>Chalnar, rubbing at the tip of his lip, slides through the door. He tucks
    a black bag into the pocket of his trousers.<br /><br />
    
    <span class="black">Good Morning</span> he says, seeming jovial.<Br /><br /> He scratches the back of
    his neck and looks at the door behind him. <br /><br />
    A young man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in and stands
    at the hut's entrance. He holds a slim stick.
    Chalnar acknowledges him, turns back to you. <br /><br />
    <span class="black">Something to eat?</span> he asks, picking at his tooth. <span class="black">You've been
    out for awhile. It would do you some good.</span>
    <br /><br />Touching at the bruise on your face, he seems right. Its pain is faded, old.</p>
