    <div class="post" id="a_brooms_the_thing">
    <h1>A Broom's The Thing</h1>
    <p>You grab at the broom. The wood feels warm in your hands, as if someone'd just been using it for hours.<br /><br />
    
 	The door splits wide with a deafing thud. It is much thicker than you imagined, perhaps six or seven inches of hard
    oak. Gales of laughter pour into the room, and men and women laugh and clink beer in the room beyond. Two long benches
    on either side of two long tables run down the length of the room. <br /><br />
    
    A barman with a thick moustache and a monocle cackles at something the serving girl's just said and wanders into the swinging
    door behind him.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="the_drinker">
    <h1>The Drinker</h1>
    <p><span class="morham">My name is Morham the Drinker if that is what you want to call me,</span> you say.<br /><br />

        The food is hot, and your appetite is fierce. Before long you find yourself itching for drink and ask if you might have something, a pint to wash it down.<br /><br />

        The request is logical– the woman is clearly a barmaid, but this is no bar and she says, <span class="black">No, I'm sorry. I'll have them bring you more water though.</span><br /><br />

        She looks somewhat worried when she faces the man, who opens the door for her as she leaves. He rubs at his wrist and the back of his neck, flicks his wrist and through the window a small polished wooden stool in parts slides through, assembles itself before him.<br /><br />

        He sits down on it, the legs just hovering off the ground.<br /><br />

        <span class="black">Drinker</span>, he says. <span class="black">It is time for a test.</span> <br /><br />

		His stool glides forward and he is before you. His eyes burn down into yours, a darkness spreading from the pupils outward across the white and with a slight chant, he tosses a small powder across your face and with an unexpected lurch, the world blackens, flashes, and you are alone in the room. <br /><br />
        
        The broom is at your knees.<br /><br />
    
    
    
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="long_gulps">
       <h1>Long Gulps</h1>
       <p>
       You take long gulps from the canteen, sputtering water almost. You are thirstier than you imagined and
       finish nearly half the canteen.<br /><br />
       
       The woman holds a giggle behind her hand, watching you. 
 		When you are done, you say, <span class="morham">What the man in the doorway is smiling at me in such a manner?</span><br /><br />
        
        She looks at the man and then back at you. No one is smiling except her. <br /><br />
        
        <span class="black">You are so thirsty! You've been under for awhile now. I think it would be good if you ate.</span>
         <br /><br />She signals to the man who knocks on the door.<br /><br />
        
        <span class="black">Tell me, what is your name, Drinker? Or shall I call you that? It is a simple enough thing to remember if you prefer.</span> <br /><br />
        
        The door opens somewhat, allowing someone to hand in a plate of wild-rice, pig, and beans to the young man, who passes it to
        the woman. She sets it in front of you.<br /><br />
    
   		</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="hello_morham">
        <h1>Hello, Morham</h1>
        <p>A tavern woman steps into the room, a slim skirt and roughspun blouse masking a bold figure.<br /><br />
        She holds a broom, smiles at you, closes the door. <br /><br />
        <span class="black">You are feeling well, I hope?</span> she says, seeming sure of the answer. <br /><br />She sets the broom
        beside the door and walks a canteen over to you.
        <br /><br /><span class="black">Water?</span> she asks.
        <br /><br />A young man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in the door and stands
        at its entrance. He holds a slim stick.
        She smiles at him and he watches you quietly. <br /><br />
        <span class="black">Would you care for something to eat?</span> she asks.</p>
