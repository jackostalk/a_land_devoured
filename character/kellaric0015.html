        <p><span class="black">I understand</span>, says the man. <span class="black">Things are likely blurry.</span><br /><br />
        
        He looks to the other man, who knocks on the door three times.<br /><br />
        
        The door opens and  a plate of pig, wild-rice, and beans is handed in by someone outside.
         The older man who walks it over to you and places the food at your feet.

        <br /><br />You recognize the raven as one of those your family had sent to its field generals.

        <h1>Hello, Kellaric</h1>
        <p>A grizzled man, face scarred and tanned, with raven on shoulder enters the room.<br /><br />
        He nods at you and closes the door. <br /><br />
        <span class="black">Feeling well, I hope?</span> he says, seeming sure of the answer. The raven's wings flap open,
        wide and dark. It turns and seems whisper in his ear.
        <br /><br /><span class="black">For your thirst</span>, he says, and tosses you a canteen.
        <br /><br />A young man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in the door and stands
        at its entrance. He holds a slim stick. The older man acknowledges him and turns to you<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Would you care for something to eat?</span> he asks.</p>
