    	<h1>Tiling Effect</h1>
        <p>You sit still for a moment before your actions. Then you are upon the rune tile, pressing down
        on that which spells strength first. With a twinge, your realize, it was attached to the floor and
        it snaps free and into your hand.<br /><br />
        
        You lay the same force into a swift punch on against the precision tile and it breaks similarly.<br /><br />
        
        Then you sit, meditating. The forest slumbers in your ears, a noiseless sound, full of life. You enter
        your wood, commune, seeking silence, answers.<br /><br />
        
        A chirp awakens you. The door in front of you is open. A thin-legged bird with a tiny hat on hops idly at the 
        doorway. 
        
        <br /><br />You sense a grace and a flexibility sustaining the limbs of your body.<br /><br />
        
        [You are granted a temporary <span class="vidius">+1 boost to your Dexterity</span> by your meditation]<br /><br />
        
        Beyond the bird is a white-tiled hallway. Box-shaped elements protrude from the walls and are covered in tile too, making
        for a dizzying tunnel that stretches to a halt at the end of the corridor. 

	<div class="post" id="the_liar">
    	<h1>The Liar</h1>
        <p>
    	You finishing the canteen in a few large gulps, take a bite of the rice and beans.<br /><br />

		<span class="vidius">My apologies for any misgivings I have, but who are you and where am I? My name is Vidius Aindur, a member 
        of our Lady of the Wood's Elidur. I am surprised you did not recognize the etchings yourselves.</span><br /><br />

        You take another bite and reach for the bow in the elf's hands to stroke the etchings.<br /><br /> 

        <span class="vidius">This bow is one of many allotted to us in the armory; these markings simply indicate 
        when it was created. We use them as identifiers to catalog them</span>, you lie, hiding the truth of the Ashwood of the Elidur.<br /><br />

        <span class="black">[You are attempting to persuade the elves that your statement is the truth. 
        You roll a <span class="vidius">14</span> on a 20-sided die + 0 for your Charisma modifier</span>]<br /><br />

        Looking back at the elder elf, you wipe a grain of rice from your lip. <br /><br />

        <span class="vidius">Apologies to disappoint, if you thought this bow retained any special abilities. To the best of my 
        abilities, it was 
        created...</span>, you glance carefully at the markings, <span class="vidius">..about 60 years ago, and matches a set of 6 others created by the
         craftsman that day.</span> <br /><br />

        The elf glances back at the bearded man and stands, taking the bow with him. They exchange mutters and
         the elf departs with his brethren.<br /><br />

        <span class="vidius">I was with a close companion, another elf, have you any idea where he may be?</span><br /><br />

        You direct the question at the departing elves, as the man closes the door behind them. 
        He rubs at his wrists and says a few unhearable words. A stool, disassembled, flies in pieces through 
        the slats of the windows and reassembles itself in front of him.<br /><br />

        He sits on it and is whisked in front of you, the feet of the stool hovering inches above the floor.<br /><br />

        <span class="black">False Elidur</span>, he says, <span class="black">it seems time for a test</span>.<br /><br /> 

        His eyes burn down into yours, a darkness spreading from the pupils outward across the white and 
        with a slight chant, he tosses a small powder across your face. The world blackens, flashes, and you are alone in the room.<br /><br /> 

        On the ground at your knees are four ceramic tiles, each inscribed with an elvish rune, runes you recognize immediately.<br /><br />

        <i>"Strength"</i><br /><br />

        <i>"Precision"</i><br /><br />

        <i>"Silence"</i><br /><br />

         <i>"Justice"</i><br /><br />

    <div class="post" id="familiar_ashwood">
    	
    <h1>Familiar Ashwood</h1>
    <p>
    You drink large but steady gulps of the canteen, never taking your eyes off of the human.<br /><br />
    
    They watch you drink. You take a breath.<br /><br />
    
    <span class="vidius">So, who are all of yall? Thank you for whatever you did to retrieve me from the horde that was descending
     on me. What happened? </span><br /><br />
     
     The silverbeard rubs at his cheek and looks about. <span class="black">Our memory is shrouded, as is yours. He and I came with you, as it turns. </span>
     He indicates the younger elf.<br /><br />
     
     <span class="vidius">How long have I been out for?</span><br /><br />
  	
     <span class="black">A few days. Hence your thirst.</span> He points at the canteen.<br /><br />
    
     <span class="vidius">I am quite hungry yes, what do you have to offer? I could eat.</span><br /><br />
     
     The elf nods, looks back at the bearded man who knocks on the door three times. <br /><br />
     
     <span class="vidius">That is a nice bow you have there, I lost mine in the midst of that cacophony of Orcs.</span><br /><br />
     
     Both elves absently play with the strings of their bows. The elder turns and grabs the bow he'd set beside the door. The door 
     opens slightly, allowing someone to hand in a plate of pig, wild-rice and beans. He brings both bow and plate over and 
     sets the plate in front of you.<br /><br />
     
     Sipping on the water more, you ask, <span class="vidius">Where am I?</span><br /><br />
     
     <span class="black">A question I will have a hard time answering</span>, he says, crouching before you. <span class="black">High in the trees. But..</span> he holds
     the bow in front of your face. Looking at the  etchings you'd watched engraved into the wood when the bow was
     being made, you immediately recognize your own bow, the familiar ashwood.. <span class="black">they want to know what these 
     etchings mean.</span><br /><br />
     </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="post" id="hello_vidius">
        <h1>Hello, Vidius</h1>
        <p>A pair of elves walk through the door, trailing each other as a breeze.<br /><br />
        Both are armed, though the elder has two bows, one which he sets beside the door before turning
        to you.  <br /><br />
        <span class="black">You are feeling well, I hope?</span> he says, seeming sure of the answer. <br /><br />
        The younger elf walks a canteen over to you.<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Water</span> he says.<Br /><br />  He returns to crouch at the inset of the door.
        <br /><br />A young human man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in the door and stands
        at its entrance. He holds a slim stick. The crouching elf acknowledges
        him and then looks back at you.<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Would you care for something to eat?</span> the silverbeard asks. 
        <span class="black">It would do you good.</span></p>
