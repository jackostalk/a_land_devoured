    <h1>Bait and Switch</h1>
    <p>The rod weighs lightly in your hand as you pick it up. Reel is attached, string taut.<br /><Br />
    
    At picking up the rod, the door whips open. It is not as hardy a door as you'd thought, appearing to be made out of
    canvas. It flaps closed, is plucked by the wind, opens again, showing bright sun and the unmarred surface of a lake.<br /><Br />
    
    The tin, upon opening, is full of teeth. Not newly pulled, aged yellow. You cannot distinguish from what creature
    they've come.<br /><Br />
    
    Out the window is blackness.<br /><Br />
    </p>
    
    
    
	<div class="post" id="the_fisher">
    <h1>The Fisher</h1>
    <p>
    <span class="leon">That looks to be my fishing rod.  Thank you very much for the food and water.  </span><br /><br />

	You look to the fisherman.<br /><br />

	<span class="leon">What else can you tell me?</span><br /><br />

	The fisherman seems strangled in his words; he holds the rod from the center and it bows on either side.<br /><br />

	He looks back at the bearded man, doubtfully, and departs; the other man closes the door behind him.<br /><br />

	He rubs at his wrist and mutters a few unhearable syllables. A stool disassembled levitates through the window, reassembles itself before him and he sits, gliding towards you.<br /><br />

	<span class="black">Fisher,</span> he says, <span class="black">your precision astounds me. Of all.</span> He pauses and spits in his hand, rubs it against his other, and then through his hair. <br /><br />

	<span class="black">It wasn't I who summoned you. Aloste is responsible for that. And she who suggested that we needed you. I simply scry and report. <br /><br />

And I test,</span> he says, looking wistfully out the window. <span class="black">Though some mornings it seems fruitless, inane even,</span> he coughs into a palm, <span class="black">there is a greater risk though of sending someone incapable into The Mog'r. Guilt.</span><br /><br />

	<span class="black">Time for your test, it seems, Fisher. Speed of Rule to you. Catch many.</span><br /><br />

	His eyes burn down into yours, a darkness spreading from the pupils outward across the white and with a slight chant, he tosses a small powder across your face and with an unexpected lurch, the world blackens, flashes, and you are alone in the room. <br /><br />

The fishing rod and a small tin are at your knees.<br /><br />

    <div class="post" id="starving">
       <h1>Starving</h1>
       <p>
       <span class="leon">Yes, I'm starving, thank you.</span><br /><br />
       The fisherman nods and the man at the door knocks on it three times.<Br /><br />
       You gulp from the canteen, surprised at how thirsty you actually are.<Br /><br />
       <span class="leon">Please tell me, where am I?  What happened? I don't remember much.</span><Br /><br />
       <span class="black">As best as they've told me, boyo, we're a ways up in the trees. Someplace, I can't pronounce it
       so well. </span>The old man picks at his teeth.  <span class="black">But I came with you,</span> he says, shrugging.<Br /><br />
        <span class="black">You've been out for a few days</span>, he says, laughing a little as you sputter up more water.  <span class="black">Thats why
       you're so thirsty. </span><Br /><br />
       The door opens and a plate of pig, wild-rice and beans is handed in. The young man hands it to the fisherman
       who in turn places it in front of you.<Br /><br />
        <span class="black">They'll treat you alright</span>, he says quietly.  <span class="black">Seems, anyway</span>.<Br /><br />
        <span class="black">But they want to know what this is</span>, he holds it out in front of you– the fishing rod which at first you 	presumed was his but on closer inspection you recognize as your own.

     <div class="post" id="hello_leon">   
        <h1>Hello, Leon</h1>
        <p>An old fisherman, rod in hand, scratches at the underside of his stomach as he
        strolls in.<br /><br />
        He asks you how you're doing, not seeming to particularly run it as a question, more a 
        greeting.<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Imagine you're thirsty. You've been under a few days now,</span> he says, setting the rod
        against the wall and walking a canteen over to you. 
        <br /><br />A young man with wispy beard and crooked eyes steps in the door and stands
        at its entrance. He holds a slim stick, is acknowledged by the fisherman.<br /><br />
        <span class="black">Care for something to eat?</span> the fisherman asks.</p>
